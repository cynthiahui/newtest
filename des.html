        <h2>Investment Types</h2>
        <div class="investment">
            <strong>Stocks</strong>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> When you buy a stock, you’re buying a tiny piece of a company. If the company does well, the value of your stock can go up, and you can make money. If the company does poorly, the value of your stock can go down.</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> High (the value can go up and down a lot).</p>
            <p><strong>Potential Return:</strong> High (if the company grows a lot).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="investment">
            <strong>Bonds</strong>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A bond is like a loan that you give to a government or company. They promise to pay you back with interest (extra money) after a certain time.</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Low (because the government or company promises to pay you back).</p>
            <p><strong>Potential Return:</strong> Low (but steady and safe).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="investment">
            <strong>Mutual Funds</strong>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A mutual fund is a big collection of stocks, bonds, or other investments. You and many other people invest money together to buy a bunch of things. This helps you spread out your risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Medium (because it’s spread out, but some things might still lose value).</p>
            <p><strong>Potential Return:</strong> Medium (it’s a mix of safe and risky investments).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="investment">
            <strong>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</strong>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An ETF is kind of like a mutual fund, but it trades on the stock market like a stock. You buy shares of it, and it holds a lot of different investments (like stocks or bonds).</p>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Medium (it’s a mix, so it’s less risky than individual stocks).</p>
            <p><strong>Potential Return:</strong> Medium (because it’s made up of many things).</p>
